This project is a Blazor-based medical calculator app designed to provide users with various health-related calculations. The solution is organized into three main projects: Domain, Application, and Web (UI). Basic functions include calculation, content management through markdown files, user authentication, email notifications, and PDF export of calculation results.

Email Infrastructure (DEV / PROD Switch)

This project implements a production-ready email infrastructure with a safe development mode.
Real email sending can be disabled locally while preserving the full ASP.NET Identity email confirmation flow.

SmtpEmailService:

- Sends real emails via SMTP
- Used in Production

FakeEmailService:

- Does not send emails
- Logs email content to application logs
- Used only in Development mode

Environment Switch (DEV vs PROD): Email behavior is controlled by a single configuration flag.

Production (appsettings.json):

"Email": {
  "Enabled": true
}

- Real SMTP functionality is enabled
- Confirmation and notification emails are sent normally

Development (appsettings.Development.json):

"Email": {
  "Enabled": false
}

- Real SMTP is disabled
- Emails are logged instead of sent
- No external dependencies required
