This project is a Blazor-based medical calculator app designed to provide users with various health-related calculations. The solution is organized into three main projects: Domain, Application, and Web (UI). Basic functions include calculation, content management through markdown files, user authentication, email notifications, and PDF export of calculation results.

*** Email Infrastructure (DEV / PROD Switch)

This project implements a production-ready email infrastructure with a safe development mode.
Real email sending can be disabled locally while preserving the full ASP.NET Identity email confirmation flow.
Environment Switch (DEV vs PROD): Email behavior is controlled by a single configuration flag.

1) Production (appsettings.json): "Email": { "Enabled": true }

SmtpEmailService:

- Sends real emails with SMTP server
- SMTP options can be easily adjusted
- Used in Production

2) Development (appsettings.Development.json): "Email": { "Enabled": false }

FakeEmailService:

- Does not send emails
- Logs email content to application logs
- Used only in Development mode
